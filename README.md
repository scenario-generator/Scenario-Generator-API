## Scenario Generator API

[![](https://circleci.com/gh/Lockyy/scenario-generator-api.png?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-token)](https://circleci.com/gh/Lockyy/scenario-generator-api)

This API is intended to be the replacement for the backend of the website currently up at [scenariogenerator.net](http://www.scenariogenerator.net)

It allows you to specify a branching scenario and then have the generate pick a random set of results from that scenario for you.

### Example

You have a game that allows you to pick a hat, some shoes, a sword, and a shield. There are ten of each.

You create a Generator with four columns 'hat', 'shoes', 'sword', and 'shield'.
Each column is then given 10 options, each option containing one of its column's thing. So the 'hat' column would have
10 options, each with a different hat.

When you visit /api/v1/generators/1/scenario you would be given a "scenario" containing a random hat, pair of shoes, sword, and shield.

This allows users to be given a random challenge, equipment loadout, or story path to use in a game.

## TODO

- Add user login
- Add user ownership of generators

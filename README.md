## Scenario Generator API

This API is intended to be the replacement for the backend of the website currently up at [scenariogenerator.net](http://www.scenariogenerator.net)

It allows you to specify a branching scenario and then have the generate pick a random set of results from that scenario for you.

### Example

You have a game that allows you to pick a hat, some shoes, a sword, and a shield. There are ten of each.

You create a Generator with four columns 'hat', 'shoes', 'sword', and 'shield'.
Each column is then given 10 options, each option containing one of its column's thing. So the 'hat' column would have
10 options, each with a different hat.

When you visit /api/v1/generators/1/scenario you would be given a "scenario" containing a random hat, pair of shoes, sword, and shield.

This allows users to be given a random challenge, equipment loadout, or story path to use in a game.

## TODO

- Pick whether to use a linked list for columns or a have_many.
  - Should a generator have a column that has a column etc. or should a generator have_many all of the columns (apart from option children that is)
  - The former allows more easy insertion and rearrangement of columns.
  - The latter makes the code a little easier to understand and reduces the amount of recursion going on.
  - Right now were're at a bit of a mix, a Generator can only have one column but a column can have_many columns. We need to pick one and stick to it.
- Add API endpoints for creating, editing, and deleting generators/subjects/options/columns.
- Add user login
- Add user ownership of generatorsx
- Other stuff that needs listing
